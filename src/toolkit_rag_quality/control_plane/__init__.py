"""
Control-plane adapter for toolkit-rag-quality.

Language-portability proof (2026-04-03):
These Python contracts are structurally equivalent to the TypeScript interfaces
in BIOS / ADII / HubZone control-plane-types.ts.  Field shapes, enum values,
and helper-function semantics are preserved across languages.

Toolkit-rag-quality is an Archetype 9 CLI tool (TK-RQ).  The control-plane
contract here covers:
  - Config hierarchy (global defaults -> toolkit config -> CLI overrides)
  - CLI command -> ToolSpec mapping for score, overlap, compare, validate-report, health
  - Optional import from akiva_execution_contracts / akiva_policy_runtime
    (graceful no-op when the framework is not installed)
